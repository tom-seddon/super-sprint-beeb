"""ay2sn.py - convert AY-3-8910 register states to SN76489 states, offline, per field.

Fork this into your project's tools/; keep this header. (Forked into Super Sprint 2026-11-02 for the race's effects, tools/sound_gen.py: its volume, period and noise rules and its renderers.)

From 1942-beeb's `tools/ay2sn.py` (Layer 8, decisions 46-54, 2026-09-10/11). There the
arcade's sound CPU was run headless from its ROM (beeb_port_kit/mame/z80sub.py) and its
two AYs' registers taken after every sound IRQ; this turned them into what the BBC's
SN76489 should hold at each 50 Hz field, so the 6502 player only replays register
values and converts nothing at run time. The rules are arkos-player-bbc's
lib/ay2sn.asm, re-derived with the clocks as parameters - which is the point of
having it here: a CPC or Spectrum source has AYs too, at other clocks.

  TONE    SN N = AY P x (SN_CLOCK / 32) / (AY_CLOCK / 16) = P x SN_CLOCK / (2 AY_CLOCK).
          1942's AYs are 1.5 MHz (`mame -listxml 1942`), not arkos's 1 or 2 MHz, so
          N = 4/3 P on a 4 MHz BBC SN.
  BASS    N > 1023 is below the SN's floor (122 Hz at 4 MHz). PERIODIC NOISE: noise
          control %011 (periodic, clocked by tone 2) with tone 2 = round(N / 15), so
          a bass voice takes tone 2 AND the noise channel, silencing tone 2 itself.
          When a drum wants the noise in the same field the drum wins and the bass
          drops an octave at a time into range instead (arkos's rule).
  VOLUME  AY 4-bit v -> 5-bit (v << 1) | (v & 1) -> 15 - ((n + 1) >> 1) attenuation
          (arkos make_tables.py). The AY's hardware envelope is not converted; 1942's
          sound ROM never set a volume register's bit 4 (sound_rip.py's inventory),
          and a ROM that does needs the envelope stepped per field first.
  NOISE   AY 5-bit noise period -> the nearest of the SN's three fixed rates BY
          FREQUENCY; volume from the loudest noise-enabled channel.
  VOICES  up to three tones. One chip's three channels map straight across; two
          chips (1942's jingles) are six, and the three LOUDEST win each field,
          STICKY - a voice keeps its SN channel while it stays selected, so nothing
          hops slots between fields.
  TN      tn_noise=True: a channel with tone AND noise both on is the AY's noise
          gated by a low square - a growl, not a note - and the SN cannot AND the
          two. 1942 plays it as its noise alone (KC 2026-09-11: as a separate square
          the gun "needs work").

IRQS_PER_FIELD: 1942's sound IRQ is 4 per VIDEO frame (measured), so the sound is
frame-locked; taking 4 per 50 Hz field keeps it frame-locked on the BBC - the same
slowdown the game takes (59.6 Hz treated as 50, decision 10), pitch unchanged.
A fraction (4 x 59.637 / 50) gives real time instead.

Everything upstream of this is exact (the sound CPU, scored RAM for RAM against MAME,
0 wrong); THIS is the one step judged by ear, which is why render_ay/render_sn exist:
the same rip through both chips, for listening side by side. Decode the chip bytes
the player writes against these states; never count them (1942 BUGS.md #66: a count
of the writes passed three corrupted tunes).

    conv = Converter(ay_clock=1_500_000)
    states, stats = conv.convert(rows)           # rows: per IRQ, [regs_chip0, regs_chip1]
    write_wav("x_sn.wav", render_sn(states, conv))   # needs numpy

A field state is [N0, A0, N1, A1, N2, A2, noise_ctl, noise_att]: a tone period and an
attenuation per SN channel (15 = silent), the noise control byte (-1 = untouched) and
its attenuation.
